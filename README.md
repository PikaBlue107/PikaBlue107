# First Contact
Hello! My name is Melody Griesen. I'm currently an Associate Software Engineer at Genesys.

I'm currently **not looking for work**.

My (slightly outdated) resume can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/PikaBlue107/PikaBlue107/blob/main/Melody%20Griesen%20Resume%20Fall%202021.pdf).

## Interests
My main passion is **process automation and organization (DevOps)**.

I also enjoy **teaching and mentoring**.

In my personal life, I enjoy:
 * arranging and performing music
 * watching and playing board games and Dungeons and Dragons
 * exploring passion projects for potential start-up ideas


## Previous experience

## Current activities
As of Summer 2022, I'm currently:
* Working full-time as an Associate Software Engineer at Genesys
    * Our team is currently in a feature lull, so we're working on burning down tech debt
* Supporting my NCSU Senior Design project while it's used by the [NCSU HINTS research lab](https://isnap.csc.ncsu.edu/home/public/)
    * For fun & self-improvement
    * The project itself: A web app for block-based program planning
* Keeping up with some open-source projects, looking for time to contribute:
    * [Rosie Pattern Language](https://rosie-lang.org/), a "better regex" search / match tool
    * [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), a new game engine
    * [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), one of the best JSON libraries for Java
* Continuing development on my passion project game, [Gaberbocchus](https://github.com/PikaBlue107/gaberbocchus) (in Godot)


## Future plans

I intend to continue my career as a Software Engineer, applying creative and detail-oriented problem solving to complex challenges.

Other niche interests:
 * git
 * pattern matching / parsing / searching
 * data pipelines
 * security

My ideal long-term position would either be:
 * A DevOps engineer/consultant developing tools to simplify and accelerate the development process
 * A teaching professor educating students and developing solutions for large-scale course administration
