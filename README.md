# First Contact
Hello! My name is Melody Griesen. I'm currently a student at NC State University in the Computer Science department.

I'm currently **looking for internships for Summer 2021**.

## Interests
My main passion is **automation and organization**. I always look for opportunities to streamline, document, and improve workflows that develop and/or use software tools.

I also enjoy **teaching and mentoring**. I attempt to explain concepts and provide assistance in ways that promote independent learning and confidence in new software developers.

In my personal life, I enjoy composing and performing music, watching and playing Dungeons and Dragons, and learning about the history of video games and speedrunning.

## Current activities
As of Spring 2021, I'm currently:
 * Serving as a Peer Teaching Fellow for NC State's CSC 216 (Software Development Fundamentals) where I:
     * teach students practical Java programming skills
     * review student code for bugs and communicate the faults in a way that builds self-learning
     * develop automation and documentation to assist other PTFs in their tasks
 * Pursuing research on extending pattern-matching formalities and implementations where I:
     * Seek out and understand existing research on a given sub-topic
     * Develop prototypes of novel academic algorithms and data structures in java
     * Design modifications to low-level parsing machines in C to integrate extensions
 * Learning as a Student at NC State, where I am taking:
     * CSC 326 Software Engineering (MySQL, Hibernate, Java, Spring, Cucumber, Angular, Bootstrap... )
     * ENG 331 Technical Communication
     * MUS 305 Music Composition
     * and others!

## Future plans
During Summer 2021, I plan to acquire and work an internship as a Software Developer.

I will be graduating from NC State University in Spring 2022.

I intend to acquire a job as a Software Engineer or Software Automation Engineer developing solutions to streamline workflows and team organization.
Other fields I'm interested in include:
 * text pattern matching / parsing
 * data management
 * Object-Oriented design

My ideal long-term position would either be:
 * A teaching professor educating students and developing solutions for large-scale course administration
 * An automation engineer consultant developing tools that simplify and accelerate the development process
