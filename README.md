# First Contact
Hello! My name is Melody Griesen. I'm currently a Software Engineer at Genesys.

I'm currently **not looking for work**.

My resume can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/PikaBlue107/PikaBlue107/blob/main/Melody%20Griesen%20Resume%20Spring%202023.pdf).

I'm currently very excited about a new music/programming passion project:
[Harmonimation](https://github.com/PikaBlue107/harmonimation),
a program for rendering music harmonic analysis.

## Interests
My main technical passions are **microservices** and **process automation and organization (DevOps)**.

I also enjoy **teaching and mentoring**.

In my personal life, I enjoy:
 * arranging and performing music
 * watching and playing board games and Dungeons and Dragons
 * exploring programming projects and following others' programming content

## Current activities
As of Spring 2023, I'm currently:

    *   I've done a few collab projects with SRE and DevOps at this point
    *   Soon I'll be owning some new feature work
    *   Previously I've spent months cleaning up tech debt & streamlining team processes
*   Starting development on a passion project: [Harmonimation](https://github.com/PikaBlue107/harmonimation),
    a program for rendering music harmonic analysis.

    *   [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), a new game engine

## Future plans

I intend to continue my career as a Software Engineer, applying creative and detail-oriented problem solving to complex challenges.

Other niche interests:
 * git
 * pattern matching / parsing / searching
 * data pipelines
 * security

My ideal long-term position would either be:
